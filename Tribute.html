    <h3 align="centre">A humble tribute to one of the epitomes of the scientific world !</h3>
    <h2 align="centre"><strong>STEPHEN HAWKING</strong></h2>

    <p align="centre">Blessed the existence of mankind by being born on January 8,1942 , the English theoritical physicist, cosmologist and author, </br> 
        known for his breath-taking contributions to the fields of General Relativity and Quantum Gravity was also equipped with a wonderful sense of humour.</br>
        Known for his historic proposal that black holes would emit subatomic particles until they eventually exploded- named as the Hawking Radiation</br>
        his best selling books were:</br>
        <ol>
            <li>A Brief History of Time- From Big Bang to Black Holes (1988)(His Autobiography)</li>
            <li>The Universe in a Nutshell (2001)</li>
            <li> The Grand Design (2010)</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Hawking's enthusiastic nature also was also proven when he featured in the two great shows - The Star Trek (1997) </br>
        and fittingly in one of the greatest sitcoms of all time- The Big Bang Theory(2007-2019). This all-rounder though having miserable </br>
        nervous system disorder went on winning great awards like Presidential Medal of Freedom(2009) and Copley Medal(2006).</br>
